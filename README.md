...Yep, that's the last thing you need today, right? Well, guess what?<br>
It’s up to YOU to defuse it before it’s too late.

But don’t panic! Sure, you’ve got 60 seconds, and sure, you have no idea what half of the modules do.<br>
But hey, what's the worst that could happen?<br>
Probably a giant explosion, but let’s not focus on that.

Get ready to solve puzzles, dodge confusion, and somehow (hopefully) save the day in this fast-paced, chaotic bomb defusing game.<br>
The clock is ticking, and you're the only one who can make it stop.
